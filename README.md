### âœ¨ Hi there âœ¨ ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ I am the Technical Communications Lead at [Development Seed](https://developmentseed.org/). This means that I know a little about a lot of things. I'm good at talking about geospatial tech and love experimenting with and testing out things that other people build. <br>

I care a lot about data literacy, all things `open` - data, science, tools and using our powers for good. I love talking with non-technical people and helping them figure out how to apply geospatial data and tools to their work or research. 

Organizations that I'm involved with or support: [Women in Geospatial](https://womeningeospatial.org/), [Women in GIS](https://womeningis.wildapricot.org/), [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [OpenStreetMap US](https://www.openstreetmap.us/).
